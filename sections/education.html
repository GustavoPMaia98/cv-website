          <p>My PhD research focuses on understanding how mechanochemical energy—the energy generated from mechanical forces such as grinding, milling, and impact—can drive the synthesis of prebiotic organic molecules. This work explores alternative pathways for the origin of life that don't rely solely on aqueous chemistry.</p>
          <p>The research investigates shock-driven chemistry under planetary conditions, simulating impact events that would have occurred on early Earth and other celestial bodies. By studying these high-energy processes, we aim to understand how the building blocks of life could have formed in extreme environments.</p>
          <p>This interdisciplinary work combines synthetic chemistry, analytical techniques, computational modeling, and astrobiological perspectives to address fundamental questions about chemical evolution and the conditions that led to the emergence of life.</p>

          Exogenous delivery of organic molecules could have played a significant role in prebiotic synthesis, based on the detection of RNA nucleobases and ribose in meteorites. However, ribonucleosides were never detected. Meteoroid atmospheric entry conditions are severe and could lead to chemical modifications via mechanochemical reactions. Moreover, oxidation reactions are also plausible, producing reactive species such as carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>).
          </p>

          <p>
          In this way, the mechanochemical treatment of ribonucleosides with carbonate and metal salts (Ni, Al, Na, and K, which are present within meteoroids) was explored, leading to the formation of guanine, adenine, and uracil as degradation products. Ethanol formation was observed for metal samples (Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>), indicating ribose decomposition.
          </p>

          <p>
          Additionally, degradation mechanisms using theoretical studies were performed with carbonate and ribonucleosides as reagents, suggesting that water-assisted ring opening was the preferred mechanism.
          </p>

          <p>
          Considering the aforementioned results, this work proposes that ribonucleoside degradation through mechanochemical reactions, intensified by carbonate and metal ions, is a novel model that justifies the presence of nucleobases in meteorite extracts.

              Heterocyclic compounds have been studied since the last century. Due to the presence of heteroatoms, these compounds exhibit unique chemical and physical properties, which allow them to interact efficiently with other molecules or even with biological systems.
              </p>

              <p>
              Within this group of compounds are heterocyclic N-oxides, which have attracted significant attention because of the roles they play as synthetic intermediates, protecting groups, oxidizing agents, catalysts, and ligands in metal complexes. In addition, heterocyclic N-oxides have emerged as a class of compounds with anticancer, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antiparasitic, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, herbicidal, and neuroprotective activities.
              </p>

              <p>
              With the aim of optimizing the formation of quinoline N-oxides from the reduction of (2-(2-nitrobenzylidene)cyclohexane-1,3-dione), eight different reaction conditions were tested, involving five distinct reducing agents.
              </p>

              <p>
              In this way, it was possible to obtain the quinoline N-oxide exclusively by using either stannous chloride or its dihydrate analogue as reducing agents, at room temperature, with yields of 67% and 53%, respectively. In all other attempts, using different reducing agents under different reaction conditions, a mixture of quinoline N-oxide and the corresponding quinoline was obtained.
              </p>

              <p>
              All compounds or mixtures of compounds obtained were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
