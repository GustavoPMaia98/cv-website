          <p>My PhD research focuses on understanding how mechanochemical energy—the energy generated from mechanical forces such as grinding, milling, and impact—can drive the synthesis of prebiotic organic molecules. This work explores alternative pathways for the origin of life that don't rely solely on aqueous chemistry.</p>
          <p>The research investigates shock-driven chemistry under planetary conditions, simulating impact events that would have occurred on early Earth and other celestial bodies. By studying these high-energy processes, we aim to understand how the building blocks of life could have formed in extreme environments.</p>
          <p>This interdisciplinary work combines synthetic chemistry, analytical techniques, computational modeling, and astrobiological perspectives to address fundamental questions about chemical evolution and the conditions that led to the emergence of life.</p>

        <p><em>Ribonucleoside stability and prebiotic synthesis</em></p>
      </div>

        <div class="expand-body">
          <p>My Master's thesis investigated the stability of ribonucleosides under mechanochemical conditions and their potential degradation pathways. Ribonucleosides are the building blocks of RNA and are considered crucial molecules in the origin of life.</p>
          <p>The research explored how mechanical energy and the presence of inorganic species (such as metal ions and carbonates) could influence the transformation of these molecules. This work provided insights into both the formation and degradation of prebiotic molecules under conditions relevant to early Earth environments.</p>
          <p>The findings contributed to our understanding of how RNA components could have been synthesized or modified through mechanochemical processes, offering a new perspective on prebiotic chemistry beyond traditional solution-based reactions.</p>

        <div class="expand-body">
          <p>During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in chemistry with a focus on industrial applications. My bachelor's thesis focused on optimizing synthetic routes for quinoline N-oxides, which are important intermediates in pharmaceutical and materials chemistry.</p>
          <p>The research involved designing and testing various synthetic methodologies, analyzing reaction conditions, and optimizing yields and selectivity. This work provided hands-on experience with organic synthesis, analytical techniques, and process optimization.</p>
          <p>This program combined theoretical knowledge with practical laboratory skills, preparing me for advanced research in chemistry and giving me a comprehensive understanding of chemical processes from both fundamental and applied perspectives.</p>
