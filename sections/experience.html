        <p>This study investigated the influence of mechanochemical processeson the extraction and recovery of organic compounds from extraterrestrial materials. Controlled mechanical activation techniques were applied to evaluate their effects on extraction efficiency, molecular integrity, and degradation pathways.</p>
        <p>Particular attention was given to understanding how mechanical forces impact sensitive organic molecules during sample preparation. In parallel, extensive experience was gained in the development, optimisation, and application of high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS).</p>
        <p>Chromatographic conditions, ionisation parameters, and mass spectrometric settings were systematically optimised to enhance detection and characterisation of complex organic mixtures. The project involved routine operation, troubleshooting, and refinement for reliable identification of low-abundance compounds.</p>
