          <p>This presentation explored the mechanisms by which shock waves generated from planetary impacts can drive the synthesis of complex organic molecules. We investigated how the extreme pressures and temperatures created during impact events on early Earth and other planetary bodies could have facilitated prebiotic chemistry.</p>
          <p>Key topics covered included shock compression experiments, thermodynamic modeling of impact conditions, and detection of synthesized organic compounds relevant to the origin of life.</p>

        <p><em>Solid-state routes to prebiotic molecular complexity</em></p>

          <p>This poster presentation detailed our research into mechanochemical reactions as alternative pathways for generating prebiotic molecules. Unlike traditional solution-based chemistry, mechanochemical processes involve grinding and milling solid reactants, which can create unique reaction conditions relevant to early Earth environments.</p>
          <p>We demonstrated how mechanical energy can drive the formation of amino acids, nucleobases, and other building blocks of life without the need for aqueous solutions, opening new possibilities for understanding chemical evolution in diverse planetary settings.</p>
